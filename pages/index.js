                    Hi, I'm Hugo! I'm a Software Engineer from Portugal with a passion for technology.
                    I like to learn and evolve with the projects I participate in while still adding value to the
                    final product and watching the evolution of a prototype, from its initial development phases to a
                    final solution. I'm very attentive to the new tendencies and innovations in technology. When offline, I love to play
                    piano and electric guitar üòÅ.
