            This project was so much fun to make üòÅ!
            I started this project to both learn and showcase my skills in the Java stack, as well as, React.
            I was curious about the Spring Framework and decided to give it a go. As it turns out I really liked it.
            As for the frontend, I wanted to relearn React as it is a very <em>&quot;javascripty&quot;</em> functional oriented framework. 
            I&apos;m really happy with how it turned out, and as a result, this is a project which I&apos;m really proud of!
            Please feel free to fork the project and contribute!
            </P>
